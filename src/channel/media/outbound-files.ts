/**
 * Shared outbound directory support (external mode, containerized runtime).
 *
 * When the SimpleX runtime runs in a container, it has a filesystem separate
 * from OpenClaw's (whether or not OpenClaw is itself containerized), so they
 * exchange files through a shared volume rather than a shared filesystem. On
 * send, the path in `fileSource.filePath` is resolved by the *runtime*, so it
 * must be valid on the runtime's side.
 *
 * - `connection.outboundFolder` — a directory OpenClaw can write to. When set,
 *   outbound media is staged there before the send command is issued. OpenClaw
 *   owns this directory (it writes it), so it is created if missing — unlike the
 *   inbound files-folder, which the runtime owns and the plugin only reads.
 * - `connection.outboundFolderOnClient` — optional. When both sides mount the
 *   shared volume at the *same* path, leave it unset and the staged path is sent
 *   as-is (verbatim). When they mount it at *different* paths, set this to the
 *   directory as the runtime sees it; the plugin still stages into
 *   `outboundFolder` but rewrites the directory prefix to this before sending,
 *   so no verbatim path is required. Has no effect without `outboundFolder`.
 *
 * Staged files are tracked (keyed by the path sent to the runtime, mapped to the
 * actual on-disk path) and reclaimed by a per-file timer a short while after
 * staging. Cleanup is deliberately NOT done on the send path: the send command
 * only hands the path to the runtime, which reads and uploads the file
 * asynchronously afterward, so deleting on send-return can race that read. When
 * `outboundFolder` is unset this module is inert and the local path is passed
 * as-is. Native mode never sets it (the embedded core shares the gateway's
 * filesystem).
 */

 * How long a staged outbound file is kept before the reaper deletes it. Must
